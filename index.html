            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are software tools that help designers manage the changes that they make to a source code during the time of development. If a mistake is made during editing and changing a source code, version control makes it easy to help fix the mistake. If a source managing team is working on the same file, version control system is a great way to allow all members to access the source with limited interruption from mistakes made. Version control system notes who changed the files, when the files were changed, the new or different things added to the file, and automatically merges changes to the same file. This overall version control system is what this lesson is teaching. To get a good grasp and the understanding of this system will make working with it much easier.

                <span class="text-muted">Remote vs. Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Within version control system there are two repositories’ where files are stored. The remote repository is the repository that is shared among team members and it is located on a remote server. The second is the local repository which is located on the individual user’s local machine. Two ways to create a local repository are to create a brand new one or clone an existing remote repository which is transferred to the user’s local machine. Both repositories are important because they are where the created files are stored. Designers can record their history of the file such as the changed or updated status of shared or individual files. These concepts are crucial to understand so that there is no confusion where files are stored. We work a lot with files during this semester!

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is part of version control system that is a free and open source that is designed to handle all types of projects with speed and efficiency. It has a fast performance and is very easy to learn. This distributed version control system grants every user a complete copy of data stored on their machine. Everything is local so it makes it easy to work from individual devices. It is meant to prevent unintentional overwrite of a file that is shared. There are various commands to familiar yourself with while using git. Some basic commands include git init, git add –all, git log, git command –am ‘Initial commit’, and git status. Some remote commands include git remote, git pull, and git push. This concept is interesting and important to know for this class because we will be working with version control system and should be familiar with this efficient part of the system.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Three States</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three main states where your files are located. These include committed, modified, and staged.  Committed is where your files are safely stored on your local database. Modified is like it sounds, where you have made changes to your file but you have not saved or committed it to your local database. The last, staged, is where you have marked a modified file that is in its current version and will go to your next commit snapshot. Understanding where files reside and how to access them is crucial for the git process. This concept is important for future lessons because I feel like we will be working with git a lot during the semester.

                <span class="text-muted">Checking the Status of your Files</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The git status command is the main tool you can use to check the state of your files. There are different messages you would see if you cloned your file or you added a new file to your project. Be mindful of these messages because it will make your designing time run smoothly. You can also track files using the command tool git add. If you want to change a file that was already tracked there is a tool for that. The tracked file would be called contributing.md and then you can use your git status command again and complete the process over again. The different tools or commands are interesting because they all do different things. Understanding what tool does what is important while using git.
